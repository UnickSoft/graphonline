Using the [=(:if:)=] Directive%0aThe [@(:if:)@] directive allows portions of a page to be included or %0aexcluded from rendering.  The generic forms of the [@(:if:)@] directive are%0a%0a-> [@(:if cond param:) body (:ifend:)@]%0a-> [@(:if cond param:) body (:else:) body (:ifend:)@]%0a-> [@(:if cond param:) body (:elseif cond param:) body (:ifend:)@]%0a%0awhere "cond" names a condition to be tested, and "param" is a parameter or other argument to the condition.%0a%0a''Note that [@(:if:)@] without parameters and [@(:ifend:)@] are identical. Also note that [@(:if cond:)@] automatically closes a previous conditional. For nested multiple levels, see [[#nested-conditions|Nested conditionals]].''%0a%0a!! Built-in Conditions [[#built-in-conditions]]%0aThe built-in conditions include:%0a%0a(:table class='indent' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if name PAGENAME:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)current page is named "''[@PAGENAME@]''" or "''[@GROUPNAME.PAGENAME@]''"%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if group GROUPNAME:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)current group is named "''[@GROUPNAME@]''"%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if auth LEVEL PAGENAME:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)viewer is authorized - meaning "what they are allowed to do" - matches a "[@LEVEL@]" where [@LEVEL@] can be: [@read@], [@edit@], [@upload@], [@attr@] or [@admin@]; [@PAGENAME@] is optional.%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if authid:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)current viewer is authenticated - meaning they have proven who they are via login - to use this the wiki must include recipe [[PmWiki/AuthUser|AuthUser]] or others which set the [@$AuthId@] variable.%0a(:cellnr:)[@(:if enabled InvalidLogin:)@]%0a(:cell:)&nbsp;-&nbsp;%0a(:cell:)username and password not authenticated.
