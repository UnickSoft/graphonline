text=(:Summary: How to customize a subset of your wiki:)%0a(:Audience: administrators (intermediate) :)%0aOne of the purposes of [[Wiki Group]]s is to allow a [[Wiki Administrator]] to customize the features of PmWiki on a per-group basis.  Here is where ''per group customizations'' come into play.%0a%0a* The ''local/'' subdirectory is used to hold local configuration files.  %0a* The ''pub/css/'' subdirectory is used to hold local css files.%0a%0aTo perform [[local customizations]] for a particular WikiGroup, %0a* place the customizations in a file called "''%3cgroupname>.php''" (where ''%3cgroupname>'' is the actual name of the page group in question) in the ''local/'' subdirectory  %0a* place the css customizations in a file called "''%3cgroupname>.css''" (where ''%3cgroupname>'' is the actual name of the page group in question) in the ''pub/css/'' subdirectory.%0aThese files will be automatically processed after processing any local customizations in the ''config.php'' and ''local.css'' files.%0a%0aFor example, to change the image displayed in the upper-left corner of pages in the "GroupName" WikiGroup, one could create ''local/GroupName.php'' containing%0a-> [@%0a%3c?php%0a  $PageLogoUrl = "/myimages/chess.gif";%0a@]%0aThe example's effect would cause all pages in the GroupName [[Wiki Group]] to use "/myimages/chess.gif" as the logo image instead of the default.%0a%0aTo add markup to the beginning or end of each page in a wiki group, see [[Group headers]].%0a%0a!!! Per-page customizations%0a[[#PerPage]] PmWiki also allows per-page customizations, simply use the full name of the page to be customized instead of the group.  For example, one can use the file ''local/Chess.`HomePage.php'' to set local customizations for Chess.`HomePage.%0a%0aAlmost any customization that would be placed in ''config.php'' can be used as a per-group or per-page customization. %0a%0aAn important exception to this is setting '''per-group or per-page customizations for recipe scripts''' included in config.php. Most recipe scripts would need any customization variables defined before the script is included. Instead of using a per-group or per-page customization php file, use a per-group or per-page conditional statement in config.php, before including the recipe script. Example:%0a%0a>>frame%3c%3c%0a->[@$page = PageVar($pagename, '$FullName');%0a$group = PageVar($pagename, '$Group');%0a//per-group customizations:%0aif($group=='GroupName') {%0a   $RecipeVariable = 'valueA';%0a   etc. ...%0a}%0a//per-page customizations:%0aif($page=='GroupName.PageName) {%0a   $RecipeVariable = 'valueB';%0a   etc. ...%0a}%0a//include recipe after variables are set:%0ainclude_once('cookbook/recipescript.php');@]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%25red%25 Note that this method cannot be used to set $DefaultPasswords, you should use Group or Page attributes. See [[Passwords]] and [[PasswordsAdmin]] for more information.%0a%0a!!! Processing order%0aFor all local customizations, PmWiki first processes the ''local/config.php'' file, and then looks for a per-page customization file in the ''local/'' subdirectory to process, followed by any per-group customization file.  If no per-page or per-group customizations are loaded, then PmWiki loads ''local/default.php''.  If a per-page customization wants to have the per-group customizations loaded first, it can do so directly by using PHP's [@include_once()@] function.%0aFor more information see [[(PmWiki:)wiki cascades]].%0a%0a!!! Custom CSS styles per group or per-page%0aTo apply CSS styles to pages of a specific group named [[Group Name]], create a file named ''GroupName.css'' in the ''pub/css/'' directory and add the CSS style rules there. To apply styles to a specific page, create a file ''GroupName.PageName.css'' in this directory with your style rules. Any CSS rules to be applied for all wiki pages can be put into ''pub/css/local.css''.%0a%0a->[@/pub/css/GroupName.css:%0a%0a  body { background: #F4C4B4; }%0a@]%0a%0a!!! Preventing group-Level configurations%0aAny customization file can set $EnablePGCust=0; to prevent later page/group/default customizations from being automatically loaded.  If a per-page customization needs to have the per-group customizations loaded first, it can do so directly by using PHP's [@include_once()@] function.%0a%0a!!! Authentication%0aAny passwords required for a group should be set in the group's [[Group Attributes]] page (see [[Passwords Admin]]istration) and not in a group customization file.%0a%0a!!! Consider Wiki Farms%0a[[Wiki Group]]s are an easy way to host multiple sites in a single PmWiki installation by giving each site its own group.  Another approach is to use [[Wiki Farms]], which allows each site to have its own set of [[Wiki Group]] and local customization files. Read about %0a%0aIf you are looking for nested group levels, you may want to consider [[PmWiki:HierarchicalGroups|Pm's design considerations on hierarchical groups]].%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0aQ: How can I apply CSS styles to a particular group or page?%0a%0aA: Simply create a ''pub/css/Group.css'' or ''pub/css/Group.Page.css'' file containing the custom CSS styles for that group or page. See also Cookbook:LocalCSS.%0a%0aQ: Why shouldn't passwords be set in group (or page) customization files? Why shouldn't group or page passwords be set in config.php?%0a%0aA: The reason for this advice is that per-group customization files are only loaded for the current page. So, if @@[=$DefaultPasswords['read']=]@@ is set in ''local/GroupA.php'', then someone could use a page in another group to view the contents of pages in GroupA. For example, Main.WikiSandbox could contain:%0a%0a--> [=(:include GroupA.SomePage:)=]%0a%0aand because the ''GroupA.php'' file wasn't loaded (we're looking at Main.WikiSandbox --> ''local/Main.php''), there's no read password set.%0a%0aThe same is true for page customization files.%0a%0aQ: Isn't that processing order strange? Why not load per page configuration last (that is after global configuration an per group configuration)?%0a%0aA: Many times what we want to do is to enable a certain capability for a group of pages, but disable it on a specific page, as if it was never enabled.  If the per-group config file is processed first, then it becomes very difficult/tedious for the per-page one to "undo" the effects of the per-group page. So, we load the per-page file before the per-group.%0a%0aIf a per-page customization wants the per-group customizations to be performed first, it can use the techniques given in [[PmWiki.GroupCustomizations]] (using ''include_once()'' or setting @@[=$EnablePGCust = 0=]@@).%0a
