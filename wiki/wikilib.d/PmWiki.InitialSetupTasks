text=(:Summary:First steps following a fresh installation:)%0a(:Audience: administrators (basic) :)%0aOnce you have PmWiki running on your site (see [[Installation]]), you can customize it for your particular needs.%0a%0aMost PmWiki configuration is performed in files called ''local/config.php'' and ''pub/css/local.css''. %0aSome configuration is done on special pages in the [[{$SiteGroup}/]] and [[SiteAdmin/]] groups, such as the [[{$SiteGroup}.SideBar]] menu.%0a%0a!! The local configuration file (''local/config.php'')%0aWhen you first install PmWiki, the ''local/config.php'' file does not exist. Copy the ''sample-config.php'' file (in the ''docs/'' directory) to ''local/config.php'' and use it as a starting point.  You could create ''local/config.php'' from scratch, but ''sample-config.php'' is already populated with many of the options you might want to adjust.%0a%0aHere is a simple ''config.php'' file:%0a%0a-> [@%0a%3c?php if (!defined('PmWiki')) exit();%0a$WikiTitle = "My New Wiki";%0a$PageLogoUrl = "http://example.com/mylogo.gif";%0a%0a# Uncomment these if needed%0a#$ScriptUrl = 'http://example.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php';%0a#$PubDirUrl = 'http://example.com/pmwiki/pub';%0a%0a$DefaultPasswords['admin'] = pmcrypt('onesecret');%0a%0a$EnableUpload = 1;%0a$DefaultPasswords['upload'] = pmcrypt('secrettwo');%0a%0a# Uncomment and change these if needed%0a# putenv("TZ=EST5EDT"); # if you run PHP 5.0 or older%0a# date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York'); # if you run PHP 5.1 or newer%0a%0a$TimeFmt = '%25B %25d, %25Y, at %25I:%25M %25p EST';%0a@]%0a%0aNote that ''config.php'' begins with @@%3c?php@@ . The PHP end tag @@?>@@ is optional, and can be left off to improve compatibility with some operating systems.  Be sure there aren't any blank lines or spaces before the @@%3c?php@@ or after any closing @@?>@@, or else you may get strange PHP error messages at the beginning of your wiki pages.%0a%0aThe ''config.php'' file above sets the value of PHP variables used by PmWiki:%0a* The $WikiTitle variable gives the name of your site as it will appear in a user's browser title bar.%0a* The @@$ScriptUrl@@ and @@$PubDirUrl@@ variables tell your wiki where it is located.  Often pmwiki can guess, but if you have difficulty with links not working or skins not being found then try uncommenting these lines.%0a* The $PageLogoUrl variable specifies the URL of the icon image that will appear in the upper-left corner of each wiki page.%0a* The @@$DefaultPasswords['admin']@@ sets an administrative password.%0a* Setting $EnableUpload to "1" enables Uploads ("Attached files").  @@$DefaultPasswords['upload']@@ sets an upload password.%0a* The TZ environment variable defines a particular time zone (see [[Cookbook:ChangeTimeFormat]]). If your site runs on PHP 5.1 or newer, it is recommended to use the function date_default_timezone_set, see below.%0a* The date_default_timezone_set tells PHP what the default time zone is. For other ways to set the time zone, and a list of identifiers, see [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php | the online PHP manual]].%0a* The $TimeFmt variable defines the appearance of time strings and (along with TZ) localizes the wiki to a specific time zone (see [[Cookbook:ChangeTimeFormat]]).%0a%0aBy setting these (and other) variables in ''local/config.php'', you can change the look and feel of PmWiki from its default, sometimes substantially so.  See [[PmWiki.Variables]] for a list of variables that PmWiki uses, and see PmWiki:PmWikiUsers for examples of sites that use PmWiki in customized ways.%0a%0a!!! Other common setup tasks%0aThe following [[variables]] are often requested when preparing a new wiki%0a* Author required when editing a page @@$EnablePostAuthorRequired = 1;@@ %0a* Set the $DefaultGroup %0a%0aThese common [[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]] recipes are also often installed immediately%0a* [[(Cookbook:)Clean Urls]] - Remove the @@?n=Group.Page@@ arguments from the end of URLs%0a%0aIf you prepare an international wiki, potentially with characters in different alphabets (Cyrillic, Greek, Chinese) or many diacritical symbols (Czech + French), please look at [[PmWiki.UTF-8]] and Cookbook:UTF-8.%0a%0a!! Security%0aReview and set up any [[security]] required.%0a%0a!!!Setting an administrative password%0a%0aThe pages in the [[{$SiteGroup}/Site]] group (except the {$SiteGroup}.SideBar) are locked by default. In order to edit pages in this group you need to create a site-wide admin password in ''local/config.php''.  To set the site-wide admin password to "@@mysecret@@", change the line to the following:%0a%0a->[@$DefaultPasswords['admin'] = pmcrypt('mysecret');@]%0a%0aYou must use the [@pmcrypt()@] function, but set the password to a value with meaning for you. See [[PasswordsAdmin]] for details about making the password more secure.%0a%0a!![[#dontmodify]]Don't modify or rename ''pmwiki.php''%0a%0aPmWiki has been designed so that all customizations can be made without changing the distribution files -- one of its design goals is to provide seamless upgrades.   PmWiki never writes to files in the ''local/'' or ''cookbook/'' directories, so placing your customizations here makes it easier to track the changes and [[upgrades | upgrade PmWiki]] without losing the changes.%0a%0aWhen changing the configuration of your site, always change the ''local/config.php'' file or add files to the ''cookbook/'' or ''pub'' directories.  Do not change ''pmwiki.php'' or the files in the ''scripts/'' directory because the files are supposed to be overwritten upon upgrading.%0a%0aYou shouldn't rename ''pmwiki.php'' either.  If you rename the file it will not be overwritten during an upgrade of the software and there will be a version mismatch.  Many administrators add an ''index.php'' "wrapper script" in the pmwiki directory that contains the following single line:%0a%0a->[@%3c?php include('pmwiki.php');@]%0a%0aJust  make an text-file. Paste %3c?php include('pmwiki.php'); into it.%0aSave the file as index.php%0aSend it via FTP to the same directory as pmwiki.php is located. %0a%0a!! Other organisation%0a!!! Upload directories%0aBy default Pmwiki uses an upload directory for each group%0a(see [[Uploads admin(#uploaddirectoryconfiguration)]]istration.%0aDeciding on accepting the default, or choosing an alternative (eg one directory for the entire wiki, or one directory per page) is best done when setting up your wiki.%0a%0a!!! Page store directories%0aBy default Pmwiki uses a single page store directory (wiki.d).%0aDeciding on accepting the default (recommended), or choosing the alternative (one directory per group) is best done when setting up your wiki. '^[[Cookbook:PerGroupSubDirectories|#]]^'%0a%0a!!Other customization%0a%0aAfter setting up ''local/config.php'' file, you may wish to make other [[local customizations]]. See the [[Cookbook:CookbookBasics | PmWiki Cookbook]] for a large number of customizations that have been contributed. And don't fear Cookbook recipes - they're well prepared, so that most of them require only to download a single file, add a one-line include command to @@config.php@@, and ''voilà!'' - they're working!%0a%0aIf you (or others sharing your server) want to maintain more than one wiki on the same server, see [[Wiki Farms]].%0a%0a!!Now what?%0a%0aDon't forget to join a [[MailingLists | PmWiki mailing list]], where you can email other [[wiki administrator]]s for help on customizing PmWiki and participate in discussions about PmWiki improvements.  Once you have your site operational, be sure to add it to PmWiki:PmWikiUsers so others will know about it!%0a
